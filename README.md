Revamped Arturo's Blog, my personal blog. The project has the following features:

        Spring Boot API with Spring Boot Security for JWT Auth
        React frontend with Context for storing the JWT as cookie and rendering things depending on users
        Free MySQL, which makes loading very slow, so please, patience is needed
        A list of recommended blog posts, a Like system for liking those blog posts that you enjoyed, Login/Registering for being able to Like the blog posts and many more things
